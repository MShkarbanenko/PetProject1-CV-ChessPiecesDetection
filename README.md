This is my first pet project in deep learning (computer vision). I implemented a complete classical ml pipeline including:

* Data prepartaion with custom PyTorch dataset

* Quality metrics implementation and custom metric (redundancy) design

* Setting and fitting the model (FasterRCNN) with Lightning AI

* Visualisation of the model's perfomance during and after the training with Lightning Logging and TensorBoard

* Analysis of the model's quality and review of it's potential practical applications
